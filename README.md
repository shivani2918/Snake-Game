# Snake-Game
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing for the GUI. The game provides a nostalgic experience with a modern twist. Control the snake using the arrow keys, eat the apples to grow longer, and try to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The objective is to see how long you can grow your snake before it inevitably collides and the game ends.
